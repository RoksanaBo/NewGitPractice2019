Git branches, fork and pull request.
--------------------------------------------

git push --set-upstream origin sdet

to create a remote branch on github that corresponds to your newly created local branch.

Clone - it's when you are getting a copy of the project from remote repository (github)
        to local repository ( on your laptop)    from server --> laptop

Fork - it's when your sre getting a copy of someone's repository on your github account.
       from someones github account --> my github account.
       And these repositories will be linked, so you can create pull requests later on.
       Fork some project to our account --> clone project from our account --> to our laptop

       When people use forks?
       When you want to be a contributor of some public open source project. In case of linux
       project, there are thousands of contributors and only one branch - master, because
       every contributor has forked project to their account.


pull - to get updates
push - to send updates

REMEMBER:
